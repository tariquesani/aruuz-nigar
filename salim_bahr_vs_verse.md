# Note on “سالم” (Sālim): Bahr vs Verse

## Summary

It must be noted that “سالم” (sālim) is a property of the Bahr’s base form (اَصلِ بحر), not necessarily of an individual verse.
A verse may not appear in sālim form due to zihāf or ʿillat, yet the Bahr to which it belongs can still be theoretically sālim.

This distinction is well established in classical ʿarūż theory, but is often blurred in pedagogical or purely descriptive treatments.

## Classical Definition

In classical Arabic–Persian prosody, a Bahr is classified as سالم if:

- its base template (aṣl) exists as a complete and valid meter without obligatory zihāf or ʿillat, and
- any modifications (zihāf, ḥadhf, qaṭʿ, etc.) are permissible but not structurally required.

The distinction between:
- aṣl al-bahr (theoretical base), and
- istiʿmāl (actual poetic usage)

is fundamental to classical arūż theory.

This principle is articulated in classical treatises such as:
- Shams-e-Qais Rāzī, *al-Muʿjam fī Maʿāyīr Ashʿār al-ʿAjam*.

## Application to Bahr-e-Khafīf

The base form (aṣl) of Bahr-e-Khafīf Musaddas is:

فَعِلاتُن | فَعِلاتُن | فَعِلاتُن

This form is:
- complete,
- metrically valid,
- and independent of any obligatory modification.

Therefore:

Bahr-e-Khafīf Musaddas is theoretically a sālim Bahr.

## The Point of Contention: Verse vs Bahr

In actual Urdu poetic practice:

- Verses in Bahr-e-Khafīf rarely appear in fully sālim realization.
- They commonly exhibit zihāf and ʿillat such as:
  - خبن (khabn),
  - حذف (ḥadhf),
  - قطع (qaṭʿ), etc.

As a result, descriptive or pedagogical systems often label the verse itself, for example:

خفیف مسدس مخبون محذوف مقطوع

This label accurately describes the surface realization of the verse, but does not redefine the theoretical status of the Bahr.

Modern Urdu prosody scholarship (for example, Gopi Chand Narang’s *Ilm-e-ʿArūż*) explicitly acknowledges that several buḥūr possess a sālim aṣl even though their common Urdu usage almost always involves zihāf.

## Reconciliation of the Two Positions

Both of the following statements can be true at the same time:

- The verse is not sālim (it shows zihāf / ʿillat).
- The Bahr is sālim (its base form exists without obligatory modification).

The apparent disagreement arises because different systems answer different questions:

- Descriptive / pedagogical systems describe what is observed in a specific verse.
- Classical / theoretical systems classify the underlying Bahr family.

## Design Implication for This Project

- Canonical classification is performed at the Bahr family (aṣl) level.
- “سالم” is treated as a property of the Bahr, not of individual verses.
- Labels involving zihāf are treated as descriptive aliases, not as changes in Bahr identity.

This approach aligns with classical arūż theory, computational stability, and correct normalization across variant realizations.
